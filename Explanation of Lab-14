In this lab, we created an object pool for the enemy clown bullets(pies). 
The ObjectPooler logic is located in the Assets/Scripts/Enemy folder on ObjectPooler.cs, EnemyClownPie.cs, and Shooter.cs. ObjectPooler.cs manages the prefab and poolsize of the pool. 
EnemyClown.cs manages the movement of the bullets and when to return the bullets if they never make contact with the player.
Lastly, Shooter.cs tells the game when to set a bullet active.
