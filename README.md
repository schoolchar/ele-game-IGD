Elephant Game

High Concept Statement
Play as an elephant in a circus, escaping and attacking the hordes of mice after you in a game like Vampire Survivor. 

Features
The player moves around like the elephant, while groups of mice spawn in and chase after the elephant.
The elephant attacks with its trunk every few seconds, but as the player levels up, they (as the circus audience) can choose new abilities and attacks, such as shooting water from the elephant’s trunk, throwing peanuts, and occasionally, throwing stray circus members.
The number of mice increases the longer the player survives. New types of mice will enter the ring with larger and more powerful attacks, different abilities (such as long range attacks, avoiding player attacks, and greater speeds), greater health, and new achievements attached to them.

Player motivation
Survive as long as you can

Unlock new weapons
Achievements that unlock with each new attack, level, and number of mice attacked
